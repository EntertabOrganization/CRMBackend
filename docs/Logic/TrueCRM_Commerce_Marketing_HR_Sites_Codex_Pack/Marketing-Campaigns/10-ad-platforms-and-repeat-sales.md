# Advertising audiences and repeat-sales campaigns

**Owner:** Marketing domain  
**Specification ID:** `Marketing-Campaigns/10-ad-platforms-and-repeat-sales`  
**Delivery:** Core V1 or Advanced per `Shared-Contracts/11-release-phases-and-dependencies.md`  
**Scope:** Owned records, workflows and contracts below; existing shared domains remain external dependencies.

## Goal / user value

Sync opted-in audiences with Meta/Google, import platform results, and connect repeat-sales conversion through attribution.

## Entities, fields and keys

Each `id` is a UUID unless it explicitly describes an external provider reference. Entities are authoritative inside this module only; fields refer to concrete logical columns or schema-validated JSON snapshots, not a suggestion to store every object in JSON.

- AdAccountConnection(id,workspaceId,platform META|GOOGLE,secretRef,externalAccountId,state).
- AdAudienceMapping(id,segmentId,platform,externalAudienceId,lastSyncAt,syncState).
- AdSyncJob(id,mappingId,sourceRevision,addedCount,removedCount,status).
- AdMetricImport(id,platform,externalCampaignId,period,currency,spend,impressions,clicks,checksum).
- RepeatSaleRule(id,workspaceId,triggerEvent,segmentId,workflowDefinitionId).

**Required relational rules:** FK relations are workspace-consistent; indexes cover `(workspace_id, id)`, common parent+status/date queries and listed unique keys. Foreign references to other modules are validated through domain services. Existing database naming and ORM conventions take precedence over newly invented implementation technology.

## API contracts

Routes below are logical paths; authenticated/public API controller routes normally use `/api/v1`, while public-host rendering and explicit redirects are served by the Sites routing layer. Define exact DTOs in the repository using the required fields in the entity and rules sections. `POST`/`PATCH` validate request body, unknown privileged fields are rejected, and list GETs have scoped pagination/filtering. Operations that create financial/provider/dispatch/send/approval side effects require an `Idempotency-Key` or durable command key. API responses use the shared envelope/error shape.

- POST /marketing/ad-connections.
- POST /marketing/ad-audiences.
- POST /marketing/ad-audiences/:id/sync.
- GET /marketing/ad-audiences/:id/status.
- POST /marketing/ad-metrics/import.
- POST /marketing/repeat-sales/rules.

**Sample envelope (successful resource command):**
```json
{"success":true,"data":{"id":"<uuid>","version":1,"status":"<valid-state>"},"meta":null}
```
**Sample envelope (validation failure):**
```json
{"success":false,"error":{"code":"VALIDATION_FAILED","message":"Request validation failed","details":{"fields":[{"field":"<field-path>","reason":"<stable-reason>"}]}},"requestId":"<correlation-id>"}
```

## Business rules and validation

- Initial ad integration syncs audiences/metrics, not direct ad campaign editing.
- Match identifiers hashed as provider requires and transfer only when advertising-use consent/legal basis exists.
- Suppress revoked subjects from future uploads and remove from audience when supported.
- Store external mapping/checkpoints and handle provider partial errors with retries.
- Ad metrics imported with platform, period, currency, original amounts and request fingerprint.
- Revenue attribution remains Sales Intelligence owner with model/time basis.
- Repeat-sale workflows trigger from Commerce/CRM durable events and use normal marketing eligibility.

## State transitions and command sequencing

- Ad sync PENDING|RUNNING|PARTIAL|COMPLETED|FAILED.
- repeat sale rule ACTIVE|PAUSED.

State updates are server-authoritative, compare expected version/state where concurrency is possible, persist state and audit/outbox atomically and reject forbidden transitions with `409 INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`. A repeated safe command with the same idempotency key returns its original result and never repeats external side effects.

## Authorization, tenant scope and privacy

- marketing.ads.manage vs analytics.read.
- Do not export unsuppressed raw PII in logs and require provider account scope.

Authorization evaluates module action and the previously approved shared scope model (`OWN`, `DEPARTMENT`, `DEPARTMENT_TREE`, `TEAM`, `ALL`, plus explicitly public/customer contexts). Filter fields and related entities according to their own permissions; do not rely on Next.js UI guards for security.

## Integrations and required dependencies

- Meta Marketing API.
- Google Ads API.
- Sales Intelligence.
- CRM/Commerce event bus.
- Workflow.

Every dependency is accessed through the owning application service or a typed adapter. Missing production dependencies are surfaced as integration blockers; automated tests may use deterministic fakes but may not claim end-to-end production readiness from mocks.

## Events, audit and asynchronous effects

- AD_AUDIENCE_SYNCED.
- AD_METRICS_IMPORTED.
- REPEAT_SALE_JOURNEY_TRIGGERED.

Each event carries `eventId`, `eventType`, `eventVersion`, `workspaceId`, `resourceId`, `occurredAt`, `correlationId`, `causationId`, `actorType`, `actorId` (when applicable), plus a minimal redacted payload. Deliver after commit from durable outbox and deduplicate every consumer by event ID/business key. Include before/after for audited mutable business fields without secrets or excess PII.

## Failure and edge-case handling

- Invalid field/value or absent required configuration: `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` or `409 POLICY_NOT_CONFIGURED`; do not fall back to a guessed business policy.
- Unauthenticated internal request: `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`; authenticated without permission: `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`; invalid cross-tenant references: non-disclosing `404 NOT_FOUND` or `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` consistently with repository policy.
- Version mismatch or conflicting operation: `409 VERSION_CONFLICT` / `409 INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`; idempotency-key reused with different payload: `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`.
- Expired public resource/token: `410 RESOURCE_EXPIRED`; upstream transient failure: `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` or durable `PENDING_RETRY` where accepting an asynchronous command is safe.
- Provider timeout may have occurred after provider accepted the side effect; reconcile before retrying; never interpret timeout as proven failure or blindly issue a new financial/send/dispatch operation.
- All list/filter/export operations must be scoped by permission and privacy classifications; retries never erase the original audit or immutable history.

## Acceptance criteria and testing

- **AC-01:** Consent withdrawn -> subject removed when adapter supports.
- **AC-02:** Import same ad metrics period idempotent.
- **AC-03:** Ads API quota error yields partial report and retry.
- **AC-S01:** An actor from another workspace cannot read, change, enumerate or reference any of this module's resources, even with a valid foreign UUID.
- **AC-S02:** Unauthorized action/field/scope returns a stable error and leaves authoritative data, outbox and audit unchanged except permitted security-denial logging.
- **AC-S03:** Retry of the same business action returns the original effective result; failed downstream notifications and analytics never roll back an already committed business fact.
- **AC-S04:** Important mutations emit a single durable outbox event and sanitized audit record, recoverable after worker restart.

**Executable test contract:** `Testing/Marketing-Campaigns/10-ad-platforms-and-repeat-sales.spec.ts` and applicable `Testing/Marketing-Campaigns/Marketing-Campaigns.e2e-spec.ts`. The tests are intentionally fail-closed until integrated with a real repository (see `Testing/README.md`).
