# A/B experiments and nurture journeys

**Owner:** Marketing domain  
**Specification ID:** `Marketing-Campaigns/09-experiments-and-journeys`  
**Delivery:** Core V1 or Advanced per `Shared-Contracts/11-release-phases-and-dependencies.md`  
**Scope:** Owned records, workflows and contracts below; existing shared domains remain external dependencies.

## Goal / user value

Support auditable message experiments and durable multi-step marketing journeys through existing Workflows.

## Entities, fields and keys

Each `id` is a UUID unless it explicitly describes an external provider reference. Entities are authoritative inside this module only; fields refer to concrete logical columns or schema-validated JSON snapshots, not a suggestion to store every object in JSON.

- CampaignExperiment(id,campaignId,allocationJson,metric,confidencePolicy,status,winningVariantId?).
- CampaignVariant(id,experimentId,contentVersionId,percentage,assignedRecipients).
- MarketingJourney(id,workspaceId,workflowDefinitionId,version,status).
- JourneyEnrollment(id,journeyId,subjectKey,workflowExecutionId,enteredAt,status).

**Required relational rules:** FK relations are workspace-consistent; indexes cover `(workspace_id, id)`, common parent+status/date queries and listed unique keys. Foreign references to other modules are validated through domain services. Existing database naming and ORM conventions take precedence over newly invented implementation technology.

## API contracts

Routes below are logical paths; authenticated/public API controller routes normally use `/api/v1`, while public-host rendering and explicit redirects are served by the Sites routing layer. Define exact DTOs in the repository using the required fields in the entity and rules sections. `POST`/`PATCH` validate request body, unknown privileged fields are rejected, and list GETs have scoped pagination/filtering. Operations that create financial/provider/dispatch/send/approval side effects require an `Idempotency-Key` or durable command key. API responses use the shared envelope/error shape.

- POST /marketing/campaigns/:id/experiments.
- GET /marketing/campaigns/:id/experiments/results.
- POST /marketing/campaigns/:id/experiments/select-winner.
- POST /marketing/journeys.
- POST /marketing/journeys/:id/enroll.
- POST /marketing/journeys/:id/pause.

**Sample envelope (successful resource command):**
```json
{"success":true,"data":{"id":"<uuid>","version":1,"status":"<valid-state>"},"meta":null}
```
**Sample envelope (validation failure):**
```json
{"success":false,"error":{"code":"VALIDATION_FAILED","message":"Request validation failed","details":{"fields":[{"field":"<field-path>","reason":"<stable-reason>"}]}},"requestId":"<correlation-id>"}
```

## Business rules and validation

- Variant allocations total exactly 100% and are assigned deterministically by stable recipient key and experiment seed.
- Minimum sample and winner metric specified before launch.
- Winning campaign version must pass existing approval gates.
- Do not modify sent variants or re-randomize recurring subjects unexpectedly.
- Journey state lives in shared Workflow durable instance pinned to published version, not separate marketing orchestrator.
- Re-entry policy configurable, default prohibit duplicate active enrollment for (journey,subject).
- Every journey send step calls normal delivery/consent service at action time.
- Retry/wait/timer idempotent.

## State transitions and command sequencing

- Experiment DRAFT|RUNNING|COMPLETED|STOPPED.
- Journey DRAFT|ACTIVE|PAUSED|ARCHIVED.
- Enrollment ACTIVE|COMPLETED|CANCELLED|FAILED.

State updates are server-authoritative, compare expected version/state where concurrency is possible, persist state and audit/outbox atomically and reject forbidden transitions with `409 INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`. A repeated safe command with the same idempotency key returns its original result and never repeats external side effects.

## Authorization, tenant scope and privacy

- marketing.experiment.manage and workflow.publish permissions.
- AI cannot auto-modify live content without approval.

Authorization evaluates module action and the previously approved shared scope model (`OWN`, `DEPARTMENT`, `DEPARTMENT_TREE`, `TEAM`, `ALL`, plus explicitly public/customer contexts). Filter fields and related entities according to their own permissions; do not rely on Next.js UI guards for security.

## Integrations and required dependencies

- Workflow runtime.
- Segments.
- Campaign delivery.
- Analytics evaluation.

Every dependency is accessed through the owning application service or a typed adapter. Missing production dependencies are surfaced as integration blockers; automated tests may use deterministic fakes but may not claim end-to-end production readiness from mocks.

## Events, audit and asynchronous effects

- EXPERIMENT_STARTED.
- EXPERIMENT_WINNER_SELECTED.
- JOURNEY_ENROLLED.
- JOURNEY_COMPLETED.

Each event carries `eventId`, `eventType`, `eventVersion`, `workspaceId`, `resourceId`, `occurredAt`, `correlationId`, `causationId`, `actorType`, `actorId` (when applicable), plus a minimal redacted payload. Deliver after commit from durable outbox and deduplicate every consumer by event ID/business key. Include before/after for audited mutable business fields without secrets or excess PII.

## Failure and edge-case handling

- Invalid field/value or absent required configuration: `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` or `409 POLICY_NOT_CONFIGURED`; do not fall back to a guessed business policy.
- Unauthenticated internal request: `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`; authenticated without permission: `403 PERMISSION_DENIED`; invalid cross-tenant references: non-disclosing `404 NOT_FOUND` or `403 PERMISSION_DENIED` consistently with repository policy.
- Version mismatch or conflicting operation: `409 VERSION_CONFLICT` / `409 INVALID_STATE_TRANSITION`; idempotency-key reused with different payload: `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`.
- Expired public resource/token: `410 RESOURCE_EXPIRED`; upstream transient failure: `503 DEPENDENCY_UNAVAILABLE` or durable `PENDING_RETRY` where accepting an asynchronous command is safe.
- Provider timeout may have occurred after provider accepted the side effect; reconcile before retrying; never interpret timeout as proven failure or blindly issue a new financial/send/dispatch operation.
- All list/filter/export operations must be scoped by permission and privacy classifications; retries never erase the original audit or immutable history.

## Acceptance criteria and testing

- **AC-01:** Variant allocation 60+30 rejected.
- **AC-02:** Same recipient stable A/B arm.
- **AC-03:** Workflow engine outage does not mark journey step successful.
- **AC-S01:** An actor from another workspace cannot read, change, enumerate or reference any of this module's resources, even with a valid foreign UUID.
- **AC-S02:** Unauthorized action/field/scope returns a stable error and leaves authoritative data, outbox and audit unchanged except permitted security-denial logging.
- **AC-S03:** Retry of the same business action returns the original effective result; failed downstream notifications and analytics never roll back an already committed business fact.
- **AC-S04:** Important mutations emit a single durable outbox event and sanitized audit record, recoverable after worker restart.

**Executable test contract:** `Testing/Marketing-Campaigns/09-experiments-and-journeys.spec.ts` and applicable `Testing/Marketing-Campaigns/Marketing-Campaigns.e2e-spec.ts`. The tests are intentionally fail-closed until integrated with a real repository (see `Testing/README.md`).
